This project is aimed at exploring the dynamics of mutation, drift, and selection under fluctuating selection pressure.  The fluctuating selection is meant to simulate environmental shifts that may allow for the maintenancy of polymorphism over time in the absence of frequency-dependent feedback.

### Goals for Fluctuating Selection Simulation Project:
	- Investigate difference between WF and MMCEE (Moran-ish) models under fluctuating selection
		- Compare/contrast the distribution of SNPs between the models, focusing on a set of (putatively) important parameters
			- Population size
			- Time spent in an environment 	
			- Selective coefficient(s)
		- Explore the effects of recombination, if any (haploid model)
	- Investigate the probability of fixation (Up0) and the rate of evolution  
	- Explore the impact of fluctuating selection on coalescent times, i.e. how do coalescent times change when fluctuating selection is taking place?
