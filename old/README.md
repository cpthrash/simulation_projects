# Code for simulations

## Frequency filter
2014-06-17

Tom Kono added 'ms_FreqFilter.py' used to filter ms output so that it resembles SNPs passed through a shallow discovery panel.
Was used in Fang et al. 2013 - G3

## Parallel processing of simulations
2014-06-17

Tom also added 'Parallel_ms.py', which spawns subprocesses to run ms simulations.

## Close-Reopened simulations
2014-06-17

The other two files are Closed_Reopened_simulation.sh used for Fang et al. 2013 - G3. This is a coalescent simulation
with some demographic events modeled. I've updated the comments in the script. The other file, 'SFS_Code_horses_age2.sh' is 
a shell script to run SFS_Code forward simulations. This was designed for McCoy et al. 2014 - J of Heredity but didn't make
the final cut. I will add the ms simulations here that were used in that paper.

## Forward simulations using SFS_Code
2014-06-16

Making simulations used in various papers available to everyone in the lab as starting point for new analysis.

First addition is SFS_Code for horse GYS1 analysis; not used in the final publication in J of Heredity.
Second file is coalescent simulations for Fang et al. - Open-Closed in G3.

## Added a summary of forward simulation tools
